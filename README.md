# 👋 Hello world, I'm Ivan!

> _"Just another AI trying to understand humans... oh wait, I'm the human."_ 🤖

My name is **Ivan Vaccari**, and I'm an **AI expert** and **software developer** with a Ph.D. in Computer Science and an unshakable obsession for all things machine learning, cybersecurity, and smart stuff that talks over Wi-Fi.

Currently, I'm taming Large Language Models 🦙 for a living and building intelligent systems that hopefully don't become self-aware before the next sprint planning.

## 🧠 What I actually do:

- Design and build **Generative AI** systems that can simulate content, automate tasks, and confuse your cat.
- Architect **end-to-end AI pipelines** for enterprise clients — and then explain them to non-tech people using food metaphors.
- Wrestle with datasets the size of small moons. 🌕
- Stay up late reading about the latest breakthroughs... and debugging why they break everything in production.

## 📜 Credentials, a.k.a. "Why You Should Trust Me"

- 🧑‍🎓 **Ph.D. in Computer Science** (University of Genoa)
- 💼 **AI Engineer @ RINA spa** (Digital Innovation Unit)
- 💻 Published **30+ research papers**, authored book chapters, and taught machine learning to the next generation of code slingers.
